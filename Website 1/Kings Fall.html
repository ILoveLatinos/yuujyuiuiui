<h3 style="color: white">Kings fall is one of the easiest raids to do as for the most part the new players can always just do add clear. However new players will have to face the toughest encounter of all… THE DICK WALL.</h3>

</h1>
<p style="color: white">Start by assigning one person to each of the activation plates. The other two people are floaters who will be in charge of clearing adds, and replacing one of the platform holders if needed.
  Start killing enemies, and one player will be randomly selected to be Torn Between Dimensions. They are the Runner, and their job is to climb platforms created by their team and retrieve an orb of light floating above one of the plates.
  To create the platforms, locate which plate has a Revenent knight on it. Kill the knight, and have the player assigned to that plate stand on it. Then, have the person assigned to the plate under the orb stand on their plate. This must be done in order. Use a floater if either of these plate holders are the Runner.
  
  Once both plates are activated a series of floating platforms will appear. The Runner will climb them, and touch the floating orb. Once they do, everyone will jump off their plates, clear adds, and get ready for the next guardian to be Torn Between Dimensions.
  Repeat this two more times. The third Runner must pick up the orb, and they are granted the Brand Claimer ability. Now they must look at the two Daughters, and identify which of the two is not engulfed in flame. Jump down to that Daughter, and steal their brand to start the DPS phase.
  Stealing the brand from the Daughter does two things. First, it removes the Daughter’s shield so that they can be damaged. Second, it forms the Aura of Invincibility around the stealer, which makes them and anyone within the radius invulnerable.
  The rest of the team should gather at the base of the Deathsinger platform opposite the DPS target. The person who stole the brand will join them, and everyone should unload their best DPS weapons at the exposed boss.
  Eventually the DPS phase will end, and the Deathsingers will cast an attack that instantly kills anyone not in the Aura. Stay in the Aura until it dissipates, and the cycle repeats.
  There are a few important things to keep in mind. During the first phase, where the Brand Claimer is being assembled, the Deathsigners will be singing the Dirge of Unraveling or Hymn of Weaving. These create a two minute timer, and will wipe the party if you haven’t stolen the Brand by the time it ends.
  
  Also, if you kill one Deathsinger then you must kill the other on the next DPS phase, or your party will wipe. It may be advantageous to intentionally leave a small amount of health on one before finishing the other.
  Finally, the amout of time you have for DPS is based on how much of the Deathsinger's song remains. Complete your runs to gather the Brand Stealer faster to give yourself more time to kill the Daugther's of Oryx.
